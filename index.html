                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <ul class="ul-details fade-in">
                    <li>
                        While working as a concierge at Mallory Court Hotel, I rediscovered my childhood fascination with how websites work during a family holiday in 2023. That spark ignited a passion that couldn't be contained.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since then, I've dedicated myself to mastering web development—spending evenings after hotel shifts learning to code, building projects, and honing my craft. After a year of self-directed learning, I committed fully to this transition by joining IronHack's web development bootcamp where I've transformed theoretical knowledge into practical applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) has enabled me to build full-stack applications with real-world functionality. As I continue advancing toward my continuous learning (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS currently), I'm bringing together a unique blend of experiences that sets my work apart.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What makes my approach distinctive is how I combine the precision from my music technology background with the intuitive understanding of human needs I developed in hospitality. This perspective allows me to create digital experiences that are technically sound and genuinely serve users.

                    <li>What did we make?: <div><br></div>
                        Pawkeeper is a comprehensive MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application designed to connect pet owners with pet sitters through an interactive map interface. The platform integrates Socket.io for real-time chat functionality and Mapbox for location-based services.
                        <br><br>
                        Pet owners can easily search for available sitters in their area using the interactive map, whilst pet sitters can create their profile and place a pin on the map to showcase their services and availability. The application features a robust chat system allowing direct communication between owners and sitters to discuss requirements, rates, and arrangements.
                        <br><br>
                        The platform was built with a clear separation of concerns, with a dedicated frontend deployed on Netlify and a backend API handling data management, authentication, and real-time communications.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Why did we make this?: <div><br></div>
                        The Pawkeeper project was born from recognising the need for a more efficient way to connect pet owners with reliable pet sitters. Traditional methods of finding pet care often involve word of mouth, notice boards, or general-purpose service platforms that don't address the specific needs of pet care.
                        <br><br>
                        We wanted to create a specialised solution that would make it easy for pet owners to find suitable sitters based on location, whilst giving pet sitters a platform to promote their services and manage their client relationships. The map-based approach provides an intuitive visual way to browse available sitters, whilst the integrated chat system streamlines the communication process.
                        <br><br>
                        Building this application allowed me to deepen my skills in the MERN stack while also gaining experience with real-time communication technologies (Socket.io) and geolocation services (Mapbox). It was an excellent opportunity to create a full-stack application with practical utility and a polished user experience.

                            This project is a multimedia interest tracking platform where users can compile and organize their favorite books, movies, music, and events. The application features a clean, intuitive interface that allows users to search for content, add personal notes, and manage their collections efficiently. Each item type (books, movies, music, events) has its own dedicated detail view with specific fields and functionality tailored to that media type.
                        <br>
                            The platform includes features like note-taking for each item, unique detail pages for different media types, and a responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. Users can manage their collections through an easy-to-use dashboard interface that organizes content by category.

                            This project was created to solve the common problem of tracking various types of media interests in one centralised location. Instead of using multiple apps or platforms to track different types of content, users can manage everything in one place. The project demonstrates my ability to work with React components, manage state across an application, integrate with APIs, and implement responsive design principles.
                            
                            The development process helped me strengthen my skills in React, particularly in areas like component reusability, state management, and creating consistent user experiences across different content types. It also showcased my ability to implement CRUD operations and work with REST APIs effectively.</li>

                            This project involved making a mobile-first website that was built around a banking application. They mainly consist of user login, checking on active card details and financial transactions which include paying taxes and even invoices. Its design focuses on its slick modern interface that keeps it functioning smoothly on every phone or desktop.
                        <br>
                            This project was a great way to start learning front-end web development as through it I could master good layout principles and improve accessibility on different devices’ screens sizes. From this exercise, I learned about responsive design theories and how to create intuitive interfaces that are easy to use for many types of devices.</li>

                            The project was my first encounter with creating a mobile-first website, which was the 'end of term' task from Jad Joubran’s course. My aim was to bring together all that I have learned in web development into practical use for strengthening it. Through working independently with minimal help, I grew up in confidence and challenged myself. Not only did this project jog my memory on key development approaches but also made me wonder about what else can be done. I then would venture into more complicated projects (the following bike checker project) that would further increase my skills and capabilities in web development. </li>

                            The project is a bike verification platform that allows for searching and viewing of detailed specifications for motorbikes. The website fetches useful information from an API when a user enters their preferred model, it then displays a list of bikes that meet the searching criteria. Users can narrow down search results and choose a particular bike to open up in separate window where they can view all the specifications.
                        <br><br>
                            In addition, there is also previously searched motorcycles section which enables users perform quick comparisons among models. Moreover, there is also an additional feature on the website to change its theme colour based on the brand colours of the current motorcycle being viewed. Besides, there is a handy button that can take you straight to the manufacturer’s website for further exploration.</li>

                            I've always had a thing for motorbikes, but it was difficult to find the right one for myself. When looking for a motorbike that meets my specifications, I noticed that in order to get specific details, I had to visit each company’s website separately which was too much work and highly inconvenient. The project therefore sought to create a platform where people can easily find and compare motorcycle specifications. At the same time, I wanted to have an attractive user-friendly design where we can visually compare different models’ specs at once. As such, this project is a manifestation of my love for bikes and how I intend on making the search process easier and more enjoyable by comparing features across bikes.</li>

                            This project was to make a game using classes and DOM manipulation (as the project for the ending of Module 1, within IronHack's bootcamp.). My game choice was a whack a mole game in a side-on style. Adding a few features to keep it entertaining and selectable, through what difficulty is desired by the player.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Why did I make this?: <div><br></div>
                            My main reasoning behind choosing this as a project, was to test myself on firstly making the game as a skeleton (no extra features). Then once that had been made, to add extra features requiring filtering through each instace of a mole or etc. Now you may be asking but why the cheats??? Well... when I was child I used to SUCK at games so I always tried to cheat them, so for the people that may struggle, you're welcome :)</li>

                            Our first impression on arrival was that of Luke, the concierge, who was standing by the hotel's main entrance. As I knew we'd need help with the cases I mentioned this to him and he replied that wouldn't be a problem. We were driving an EV, so had to head to the charge point, which was some distance from the main entrance, across a largish car park. There was a 7.5kw point free, so we plugged in and found Luke had quietly followed us across to the point, ready to take our suitcases. That was pretty impressive, for a country hotel.
